# MRTwin-replication

Scripts needed to replicate the MR-Twin (https://github.com/nlapier2/MR-Twin) analysis. Instructions for replicating simulations and real data are in their respective directories.

Because we used genotypes and phenotypes from the UK Biobank, we cannot release them publicly. Thus the user will have to replicate the files following the instructions in the paper before being able to replicate the results. Please let us know if the instructions need to be clarified.

* simulation_ukbb_geno/ contains the scripts for the main text simulations, which use the UK Biobank genotypes

* real_data_ukbb/ contains the scripts for the main text real data analysis, which again uses the UK Biobank genotypes

* supplementary_simulations/ contains scripts and data for the simulations in the supplementary note, which use simulated genotypes

* demo/ contains scripts and data for running a demo of our method. See https://github.com/nlapier2/MRTwin-replication/wiki/Running-MR-Twin-Example for details.
