# MRTwin-replication

Scripts needed to replicate the MR-Twin (https://github.com/nlapier2/MR-Twin) analysis. Instructions for replicating simulations and real data are in their respective directories.

* demo/ contains scripts and data for running a demo of our method. See https://github.com/nlapier2/MRTwin-replication/wiki/Running-MR-Twin-Example for details.

* real_data_ukbb/ contains the scripts for the main text real data analysis, which uses the UK Biobank genotypes. Because we used genotypes and phenotypes from the UK Biobank real data analysis, we cannot release them publicly. Thus the user will have to replicate the files following the instructions in the paper before being able to replicate the results.

* supplementary_simulations/ contains scripts and data for the simulations in the supplementary note, which use simulated genotypes
