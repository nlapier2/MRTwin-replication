# MRTwin-replication

Scripts needed to replicate the MR-Twin analysis. Instructions for replicating simulations and real data are in their respective directories.

Because we used genotypes and phenotypes from the UK Biobank, we cannot release them publicly. Thus the user will have to replicate the files following the instructions in the paper before being able to replicate the results. Please let us know if the instructions need to be clarified.
