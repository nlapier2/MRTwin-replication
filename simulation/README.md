## Replication code for simulation in the supplementary


mrtrio_controlPC.R contains the pipeline for genotype and trait simulation, together with statistics computation for MRTwin, Brumpton and IVW. 
You can easily run the script using
```
sh runmrtrio.sh
```
To change to parameters, you can modify the `params.txt` file. The explanation of each variable can be found in `mrtrio_controlPC.R`.
