generator.R: simulate the external data and the trio dataset

simulator.sh: run generator.R and save the simulated results, and further perform analysis using other python-based methods (e.g. MR-Twin, MR-sib, MR-duo)

benchmark.R: contains all the neccessary code needed to replicate the results in the simulation in the main paper and the supplementary

benchmark\_run.sh: run the method benchmarking (MR-Twin is also partially re-implemented using R for the ease of comparison)
